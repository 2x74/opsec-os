# Privacy isn't earned.
Recently, laws like the Online ~~Safety~~ Surveilance Act in the UK have made it harder than ever to stay private and anonymous online, with the only reason being "for the kids". The USA has a similar law aswell (KOSA). This project isn't the simple solution, but it is one step in the right direction.
## Features
- Minimalist, fast distro built on runit (f*ck systemd)
- Enough applications to stay private, but not enough to be bloated
- It isn't arch (f*ck arch)

# DISCLAIMER !!!
1. This project was made solely by me. All other contributors are to do with the void-mklive repo and should not be contacted if something goes wrong with OpSec OS
1a. TLDR: I am the only person working on OpSec OS.

2. OpSec OS was made by a singular highschool student as a first project, there will be issues and bugs!! Please do not be harsh when giving criticism, I only accept constructive forms. 

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/2x74/opsec-os.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd opsec-os

# use the build-iso script, this builds the iso for you (this is good if you want to edit what packages are in the iso and whatnot)
sudo ./build-iso.sh
```
OR you just use the already built iso and either flash to a usb via either Balena Etcher, or with Ventoy.

## Things used to make OpSec OS

- void-mklive
- Photopea (for the images)
